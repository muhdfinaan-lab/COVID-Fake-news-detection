# COVID-Fake-news-detection
## Project Overview

Fake news has become a major challenge in today’s digital world, influencing public opinion and spreading misinformation rapidly.
This project focuses on building a Fake News Detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify news articles as real or fake.

The goal of this project is to understand how machine learning models work with real-world unstructured text data and to apply NLP techniques in a practical, end-to-end pipeline.

## Objectives

Analyze and preprocess raw news text data

Extract meaningful features using NLP techniques

Train machine learning models for text classification

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

Gain hands-on experience with applied NLP and ML workflows

## Technologies & Libraries Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

scikit-learn

NLTK

Pandas

NumPy

 ## Methodology

The project follows a complete NLP and machine learning pipeline:

### Data Loading

Import and explore the news dataset

Identify labels for real and fake news

### Text Preprocessing

Lowercasing text

Removing punctuation and special characters

Tokenization

Stopword removal

Text normalization

### Feature Extraction

Convert text data into numerical form using NLP techniques

Prepare features suitable for machine learning models

### Model Training

Train machine learning classifiers on processed text data

Tune model parameters for better performance

### Model Evaluation

Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Compare results to identify the best-performing model

## Results

Successfully classified news articles as real or fake

Demonstrated how NLP techniques improve text-based classification

Achieved reliable performance using traditional machine learning models

(Exact metrics may vary depending on dataset split and model configuration.)
